  - GDI Primitives
    - Line
    - Curve
    - Plane
    - Bitmap Image
  - Bezier Curve


## Executed Tasks:
  - **Mandatory Tasks:**
    - Draw few lines of different colors and weights.
    - Draw a Bezier curve.
    - Draw few plane objects(ex. circle, square, pie, polygon, ) of different colors, weights, filled and not.
    - Draw 2 different objects using mouse.

  - **Tasks With Points:**
    - Draw a custom bitmap (1pt)
    - Add a switch(button, select list...) that will change mouse ability to draw objects(2 pt)
    - Draw a ezier curv using mouse (1pt)
    - Fill an object with a gradient (1pt)
    - Use mouse as an eraser of:
      - a fixed width (1pt)
      - a adjustable width (2pt)

  - **Additional Tasks:**
    - Added an Toolbar similar to PhotoShop with an Bitmap :).
    - Added 2 scrollbars 1 for color and 1 for gradient.
    - Added 1 button for clearing the drawing area.

## Development
 Fun Fun and again Fun. I am proud of myself :). I made my little paint. Look what I can do with it.
 
 It tooked me a while to figure out, how Windows sends the message of pressing a button to an element from my App. 
 Also, my scrollbars are a little bit messed up( the one that are responsible for resizing ), I think this is because my window is not updating as it should, since my scrollbar that is responsible for changing the color of an text is working fine.
 
 I really loved to work with resources, it gived me a much better control over design, which makes for a good level of customization in an application. For example, when I created "About Box" it was easier to give the coordinates and size of an icon and other elements from that Box, and on the other hand is very easy to change the default window icon and coursor icon.
 
 In the end, I can say that it was a good challenge
