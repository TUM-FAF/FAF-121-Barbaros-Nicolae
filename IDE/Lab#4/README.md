### Mandatory 
  - Create and application that will learn you the basic of debugging and testing using MonoDeveloper and Unity3D

### Tasks With Points:
  - Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)
  - Create a class that will test your application (2pt)

 I have a class in a class also a structure in that class so ass you can see just by holding the cursor on the object class you can get into the class and see the variables.

## Development

Testing and debugging is a very powerful "weapon" for Unity.  By writing this class I was able to test with help of assert which  verifing your input in the Inspector (Unity), for example assert in a string is to be a string not a null,  or if a given  number or situation in your app is as you expected.

Hopefuly I will have enought points from previous labs. For this one I am out of ideeas ))
