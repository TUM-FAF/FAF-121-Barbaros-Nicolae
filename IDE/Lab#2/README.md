  It is 4102. Aliens invaded us. Luckily the world has some great engineers and you are one of them! Your'e working on an unbeatable weapon: Simulatron. Simulatron is an exact copy of alien ship but it has a secret: when the alien gets into ship the alien is traped and brought into human prison. Your task is very simple: you have to clone Simulatron's control panel. World depends on you

## Executed Tasks:
  - **Mandatory Tasks:**
    - Define 3 virtual tasks that you Simulatron is supposed to control.
    - Create a GUI application with 5 standard controls
  - **Tasks With Points:**
    - Add 3 non-standard controls (2pt)
    - Make controls to interact. At least 3 interactions (1pt)
    - Create a custom control(not existent in IDE)(2pt)
    - Create a Reset button. On clicking this button all controls should go to their default state (1pt)
    - Set a breakpoint in your application and check variables values at that moment of time (1pt)
    - Set debug watches that will not stop your application from running but will allow you to check any application's state(ex. if a function was called) (1pt)

  - **Additional Tasks:**
    - Fun effects and music.(1pt)
    - Creating a local Data Base (working with tables) (2pt)
    - Switching from one form to another(1pt)
    - Good looking app (1pt)

3. Creation of Data Base

As you can see from video, you have to loggin, and this requires some data. With visual studio is easy to create a DB.

      - Create a DB
      - Create Tables
      - Write your info in fields

## Development
 
I realy strugledWell until now I thought that windows forms sucks, but after doing this lab my thought has changed from sucks to GOLD!! . Windows forms gives us the possibility to build an app in just no moments. Drag link, drag link, write some code and Baaam, you have a program.

In this lab I tried to add as much as fun as I could. I really enjoyed doing it.

Building my own local Data Base (SQL), switching from one form to another, having fun with animations, in one word AWESOME!!

I hope you will give me some points for Additional Tasks (Don’t you?)
