# Interactive Development Environments Laboratory Work #3

## Mobile Applications Development
  - **Android Studio**

### Prerequisites:
  - IDEs: Android Studio
  - Languages:Java
  - Technologies and Frameworks:Android

### Mandatory Tasks:
  - Study design guidlines for any mobile OS ([Android](https://developer.android.com/design/index.html), [iOS](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/userexperience/conceptual/MobileHIG/index.html), [Windows Mobile](http://dev.windowsphone.com/en-us/design))
  - Create a mobile app and launch it on emulator/simulator. Your app should have at least 3 element (ex. button, textarea, statusbar...) and one action (ex. clicking on a button will trigger a popup)

### Tasks With Points:
  - Install your application on a mobile phone. It should have somewhere your full name (on main screen, in settings...) (2pt)
  - Create 3 different views (ex. one with a list of some element, one with some settings and one with application description) (2pt)
  - Debug an application. At some point you'll have bugs (ex. null pointer exception). Set breakpoints and/or watchers. Find out buggy variables. (1pt)
  - Use a hardware device for testing and debugging (1pt)
  - Create a screen cast describing you application functionality. Use both video and audio. Mute screencasts does not count (1pt)
  - Create a responsive layout (1pt)

## Development
 
Well this lab gave me an introduction to Android Studio and Java language (even though I worked a little bit with java in the past it was a pleasure to come back to it).

As I said in the video, even if this app is not saving contacts for a long time (until you relaunch it) sometimes when you need to save something and you don’t have anything else than this app, than this app is a life saver
