## Development
 This laboratory work was the most challenging and amazing lab until now. I was able to understand how animation is done in WinAPI (even if it's hard), how to detect collision between 2 objects, how to make my little app more "attractive" (by adding some effects and sound), how flickering and double buffering it's working.
 
 The flickering was solved using double buffering and avoiding the call to erase background 

In special I had fun with NyanCat, I can control it's possition with keys and in the end it leaves a rainbow tail :))
