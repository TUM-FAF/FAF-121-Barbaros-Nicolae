## Conclusion


Everything is possible if you want to do it, this laboratory work is one of this “everything”. Well it was good to work in teams, except it wasn’t so good with github. Our story started from not making our own working branch ))) We worked only on master branch and at every 5- 10 minutes there was an conflict ))), but still we were to lazy to build 2 more branches. Any way it was fun, it was fun to work again for the sake of just making an useless game, well it’s not so useless but still,  nobody will play it (even though I’m hopping) :D . 

Good luck and see you In other repository
