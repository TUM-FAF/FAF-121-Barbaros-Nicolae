##[Link to the repository where we worked](https://github.com/IuraGaitur/FindDifference)
## Title
Collaboration. Complex application.

## Contents
* Collaboration
* All previously studied things

## Mandatory Objectives
* Create an application which has:
  * Child windows controls
  * GDI animation
* Animation should be controlled by controls

## Objectives With Points
* Work on this project in a team of 2-4 **(2 pt)**
  * Divide tasks and describe them in readme (for each task indicate who is responsible for it) **(1 pt)**

  		- create the sketch for aplication
      - dissable window resize option
      - get screen coordonates

      - create the title and the story
      - add actions to _checkboxes_, if a difference is found - one is checked
      - create dialogboxes
      - clean up and make the code visible

* Make it useful (you may ask me to evaluate usefulness of your application idea) **(2 pt)**
  
  Our application is not so useful, but is a perfect game for kids. It is an interestig and funny mini-game which develop the spirit of observation.
